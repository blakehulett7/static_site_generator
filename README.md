This is my 2nd boot.dev project. Let's get it!

Quick Note: Textnode split by delimeter function currently returns textnodes with empty strings at the beginning or end of the list if the first or last word of the old node is surrounded by the delimeter. Looking forward, this shouldn't cause issues in the html conversion. But, if it does, come back to that function located in the textnode.py file and change it to mirror the code from the src/inline_markdown.py file in the Ch.3 lesson 1 solution.

## Version 1 Finished!!!
